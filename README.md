1. Implement and demonstratethe FIND-Salgorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a
.CSV file. 

2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set
of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can
be used for this problem.
